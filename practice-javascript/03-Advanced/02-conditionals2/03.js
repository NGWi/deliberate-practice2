// Write a program that stores a person's order value and membership level (regular or premium). Then calculate a discount amount based on the following conditions:

// If the total order value is less than $50, there is no discount.
// If the total order value is between $50 and $100, the discount is 5% for regular customers and 10% for premium customers.
// If the total order value is greater than $100, the discount is 10% for regular customers and 15% for premium customers.
