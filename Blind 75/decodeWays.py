## Decode Ways
# A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:

# 'A' -> "1"
# 'B' -> "2"
# ...
# 'Z' -> "26"
# To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

# "JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
# "JL" with the grouping (10 12)
# The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.

# Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "12"

# Output: 2

# Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "01"

# Output: 0
# Explanation: "01" cannot be decoded because "01" cannot be mapped into a letter.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 100
# s consists of digits
